# Foundations in Scientific Computing

**A five-day, intensive, hands-on workshop on the foundational skills that everyone using computers in the pursuit of science should have.**

*Offered for the first time 2–6 January, 2016, at Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile.*

Every student today (graduate or undergraduate) is using computers on a daily basis.
But to be proficient with computers as a tool for science, you need professional-grade skills.
This workshop teaches the computing skills that we—as a research group in computational science and engineering—think everyone should have.

In recent years, the concern for reproducibility in computational science has gained traction.
Our research group has been pushing for several years the adoption of better standards for reproducible research.
These standards include treating scientific software as a core intellectual product, adding automation to our data handling and analysis, and the open sharing of our digital objects.

This course provides an introduction to the tools and techniques that we consider fundamental for responsible use of computers in scientific research. They include the following:

1. command line utilities in Unix/Linux 
2. open-source scientific software ecosystem (our favorite is Python's)
3. software version control (we advocate the distributed kind: our favorite is git)
4. good practices for scientific software development: code hygiene and testing
5. knowledge of licensing options for sharing software 

The weeklong workshop also includes a presentation and discussion of the ["Barba-group Reproducibility Syllabus"](https://hackernoon.com/barba-group-reproducibility-syllabus-e3757ee635cf#.wn9brj30m)—an annotated bibliography of our Top-10 readings in the topic of reproducibility.
Number 7 in the list of readings is an article titled "Ten simple rules for reproducible research" (Sandve et al., 2013).
Two unifying ideas run through the "ten simple rules":
(1) that automation is a key device for reproducibility, and
(2) that version control is the core technology for dealing with software as a living, changing thing.
These ideas justify insisting that command-line skills are a must.
