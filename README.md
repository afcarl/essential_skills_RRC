# Foundations in Scientific Computing

A five-day, intensive, hands-on workshop on the foundational skills that everyone using computers in the pursuit of science should have. 

*Offered for the first time 2–6 January, 2016, at Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile.*

Every student today (graduate or undergraduate) is using computers on a daily basis.
But to be proficient with computers as a tool for science, you need professional-grade skills.
This workshop teaches the computing skills that we—as a research group in computational science and engineering—think everyone should have.
