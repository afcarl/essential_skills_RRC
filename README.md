# Foundations in Scientific Computing

A five-day, intensive, hands-on workshop on the foundational skills that everyone using computers in the pursuit of science should have. 

*Offered for the first time 2–6 January, 2016, at Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile.*

Every student today (graduate or undergraduate) is using computers on a daily basis.
But to be proficient with computers as a tool for science, you need professional-grade skills.
This workshop teaches the computing skills that we—as a research group in computational science and engineering—think everyone should have.

In recent years, a concern for reproducibility in computational science has gained traction.
Our research group has been pushing for several years the adoption of better standards for reproducible research.
This course provides an introduction to the tools and techniques that we consider fundamental for responsible use of computers in scientific research. They include the following:

1. command line utilities in Unix/Linux 
2. open-source scientific software ecosystem (our favorite is Python's)
3. software version control (we advocate the distributed kind: our favorite is git)
4. good practices for scientific software development: code hygiene and testing
5. knowledge of licensing options for sharing software
