# `vi` movement commands

`vi` or `vim` is a popular and powerful command line text editor. It's also
notoriously difficult for beginners. It's too much to try to learn `vi` on top
of everything else we're going to look at, but we do need to look at a few `vi`
commands.

Why? Because a lot of *nix programs inherited parts of their interface from `vi`
and you'll need to know how to interact with them.

| Command         | Action       |
|-----------------|--------------|
| j or Down Arrow | Down         |
| k or Up Arrow   | Up           |
| q               | Quit         |
| g or <          | Go to top    |
| G or >          | Go to bottom |
