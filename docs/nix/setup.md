# Workshop files

Before we start, you should download the following zip file:

[https://github.com/gforsyth/uber-trip-data/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/gforsyth/uber-trip-data/archive/master.zip)

Don't worry about waiting for it to finish, we just want to get the download
started so that it's ready for later.

# Open a terminal

We are going to be using the terminal A LOT. That's because the terminal is
awesome.

On Ubuntu, you can open a terminal using the shortcut `Ctrl-Alt-T`.

On OSX, open a finder window and browse to `Applications->Utilities->Terminal`
(you can also download and install [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) which is a
really nice terminal client written for OSX)

If you are using Windows, you will need to follow
the [instructions provided by Software Carpentry]() for configuring your machine
to use UNIX-like tools.

# History

For almost all of this tutorial we will explain every command as we come across
it with this one exception. For now, please copy and paste the following command
into your terminal -- we'll talk more about it later.

```text
export HISTFILE=~/terminal_history_$(date -I)
```

Ok, on with the show!
