# Open Licensing

## What is meant by "open"?

In an [October 2015 interview](http://rtalbert.org/blog/2015/interview-lorena-barba), Prof. Barba addresses why she advocates so strongly for open-source technology in research and education. 
She explains: 

_"Free and open-source software (FOSS) is a human invention of tremendous impact. It poses an alternative to intellectual-property instruments that are limiting and want to control how a creative work is used. Open-source licenses allow people to coordinate their work freely, within the confines of copyright law, while making access and wide distribution a priority. I’ve always thought that this is fundamentally aligned with the method of science, where we value academic freedom and wide dissemination of scientific findings."_

There are two ideas here. One is that open-source licenses give us a framework that promotes collaboration. 
Certainly, access and wide dissemination are a priority. But the power of open-source software comes not just from being able to _read_ the source code, but from being able to _contribute_ to and _build_ from it. 
For this power to be realized, it's not sufficient to make the source public to read. 
We must attach a **license** that allows others to modify and distribute the code. 

The second idea present in the quote above is that open source is aligned with the method of science. 
Barba continues: 
_"It’s a long tradition in science that publication of scientific findings should be accompanied by detailed description of materials and methods, such that another scientist may be able to replicate the findings. […] I frankly cannot see how one can publish a scientific finding that relies on software, without the source code of the software that generated the findings also being public. The code is part of the method and findings cannot be replicated without it."_
