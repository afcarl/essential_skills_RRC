# Open Licensing

## What is meant by "open"?

In an [October 2015 interview](http://rtalbert.org/blog/2015/interview-lorena-barba), Prof. Barba addresses why she advocates so strongly for open-source technology in research and education. 
She explains: 

_"Free and open-source software (FOSS) is a human invention of tremendous impact. It poses an alternative to intellectual-property instruments that are limiting and want to control how a creative work is used. Open-source licenses allow people to coordinate their work freely, within the confines of copyright law, while making access and wide distribution a priority. Iâ€™ve always thought that this is fundamentally aligned with the method of science, where we value academic freedom and wide dissemination of scientific findings."_
