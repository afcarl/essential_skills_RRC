# Intro to testing

Before starting with a quick introduction to testing, we want to make sure you
install `pytest`, the Python testing tool that we will use for writing our
tests. 

If you haven't installed `pytest`, you can do it using conda, open a terminal
and type:

`conda install pytest`

Alright! Now we can start by writing some code and some tests for it. If you
want to read more about the documentation of `pytest` here is a [link](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html) where you can find all its 
documentation.
