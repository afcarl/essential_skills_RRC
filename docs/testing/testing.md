# Intro to testing

Before starting with a quick introduction to testing, we want to make sure you
install `pytest`, the Python testing tool that we will use for writing our
tests. 

If you haven't installed `pytest`, you can do it using conda, open a terminal
and type:

```text
$ conda install pytest
```

Alright! Now we can start by writing some code and some tests for it. If you
want to read more about the documentation of `pytest` here is a [link](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html) where you can find all its 
documentation.

## Testing my_dot_product function

First of all let's open a terminal and create a new file called
`my_dot_product.py`. If you are using `nano` type in a terminal:

```text
$ nano my_dot_product.py`
```
