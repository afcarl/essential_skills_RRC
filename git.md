# Intro to `git` and GitHub

## Initial configuration

`git config` to set editor, colors, email, name, etc... (use `nano`)

## First commands

`add`, `status`, `init`, `commit`, `log`, `checkout`

## Remotes

`clone`, `push`, `pull`

## GitHub add collaborator

Students pair up, push to same repo. Try force a conflict (and also a rejected
push)
