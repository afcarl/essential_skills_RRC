# Intro to `git` and GitHub

## Initial configuration

`git config` to set editor, colors, email, name, etc... (use `nano`)

## First commands

### Making commits
`add`, `status`, `init`, `commit`

Not necessarily at the beginning, but I want to emphasize that multiple files
can be added to a commit. This is often glossed over in tutorials and it's
important and powerful.

### Viewing commits
`log`, `checkout`, `diff`

### Collaborating

`clone`, `push`, `pull`, `remote` (note `fetch` and `merge` but do not dwell)

## GitHub add collaborator

Students pair up, push to same repo. Try force a conflict (and also a rejected
push)

## Branching and Pull Requests

This might be presented as a demonstration with a followup assignment.

## Advanced `git` features demo

`bisect` for finding bugs
(ideally an automatic bisect for demo purposes)
