# Python (IPython)

Python is a dynamic and high-level language that is easy to learn and it is fun to use. It plays nicely with other languages like C/C++ and Fortran. 

Python itself is an **interpreter**, it translates Python *source code* into instructions that the computer can understand. It's a dynamic language (duck typing), i.e you don't need a type to invoke an existing method on an object. 

*"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck."*
