Notes:
* Monday: Beginning of Jupyter 1: `mkdir notebooks`
* Tuesday: at end of git, `git init` notebooks folder, add and commit notebook(s)
* Tuesday night HW: Read through Laplace lesson on nbviewer
* Wednesday Lunch: Gil and Naty PR laplace lesson notebook to all students' notebook repos



# Topics
## Linux command line

* The ultimate power tool to allow people to do complex things with just a few
  keystrokes. Combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive
  tasks to avoid typing the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is
  fundamental to reproducibility in scientific computing.
  - Navigation
  - File Handling
  - Redirection
  - Piping
  - `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sort`, `wc`, `grep`, `less`

## The Python Scientific Stack

* Used by a large and growing base of scientists, Python is a dynamic,
  user-friendly language with a powerful array of helper libraries (NumPy,
  SciPy, matplotlib, SymPy, etc...).

## git (version control)

* Stop saving multiple versions of files and never worry about losing your work
  again. Ever. Collaborate with other scientists and programmers around the
  world using GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab

## Jupyter

* Seamlessly combine text, equations (LaTeX), code and results in a single,
  easily shared document

## Numba

* Take clear, readable Python code and make it perform like C with just a few
  additional lines (and no pointers). Learn to profile your code and know where
  to spend your valuable time optimizing.

# Talks

## Reproducibility in Scientific Computation



## Testing and Code Hygiene

* Make changes to your code without worrying about breaking everything. Writing
  readable code, since it's always difficult to email yourself 3 months in the
  past.

## Software Licensing

* How to take part in the open source community and contribute back without
  losing credit. Receive feedback, insight, bug reports from your users and
  collaborators


## Application 
 - Diffusion and Poisson
 
## Also

* Continuous integration
* xonsh
* advanced profiling
