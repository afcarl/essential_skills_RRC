# The Notebook

The *notebook* is a document that allows as to combine text elements (headings, 
paragraphs, hyperlinks), equations (LaTeX), figures and interactive code. The
notebook uses cells to divide text and code: text is formatted using markdown,
and code is executed using the IPython kernel. 

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a simple way to
format text; it has a plain text formatting syntax that can be converted easily
to HTML. It is easy to learn, check out the syntax in the "Daring Fireball" 
(by John Gruber) [webpage](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
